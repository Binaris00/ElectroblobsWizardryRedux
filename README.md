## About

![Ice wand inside Arcane Workbench block](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/950556ffcccb39aeb9831ce1e991ad94d87bba12.png)

Wizardry isn't like most magic mods. It has very few crafting recipes and no complex constructions or systems behind it, so you don't have to interrupt your experience by checking how to do everything. Find spell books, upgrade wands, create quick scrolls, fight against elemental spirits, trade with wizards and many more!

With more than 180 spells (and still adding more) each one with unique features, so you will always find something new to see and enjoy. You could also add spell packs that could add more content to your adventure. Will you be able to collect each one of the spells that are lost in the arcana?

Start by mining Magic Crystals (though there are "easier" ways to find them if you explore!). Combine 1 Magic Crystal + 1 Stick + 1 Gold Nugget to craft your first wand and begin your arcane apprenticeship.

## Features

- 180+ spells, each with unique and special behaviors
- 8 different magic elements (Fire, Ice, Earth, and more!)
- Upgrade your wand to cast higher-tier spells
- Discover 4 new elemental armor sets and over 70 powerful artifacts
- Interact with good wizards or challenge evil mages hidden throughout the world

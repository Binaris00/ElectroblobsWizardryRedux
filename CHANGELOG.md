- Fixed [Forge] Client-side spell data not syncing after player death/respawn, causing learned spells to appear as not learned in wand UI
- Fixed crash when loading spell properties from other mods (e.g., spell_engine) - now properly validates spell existence before parsing properties
- Added MixinExtras on common/forge code and removed LocalCaptures to @Local injections for better compatibility with other mods
